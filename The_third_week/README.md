## Version Manager
In Python, a version manager is a tool that helps you manage multiple versions of the Python programming language on your system. It allows you to switch between different Python versions with ease, depending on the requirements of your projects.

One popular version manager for Python is pyenv. It enables you to install and manage multiple Python versions side by side. With [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), you can easily switch between different Python versions for different projects or even within the same project.

Here's a basic explanation of how pyenv works:

- Installation: You need to install pyenv on your system, typically through the command line using a package manager like Homebrew (for macOS) or apt-get (for Linux).

- Python installation: Once pyenv is installed, you can use it to install different Python versions. You can specify the desired Python version during the installation process.

- Version management: After installing multiple Python versions, you can use pyenv to manage them. You can set a global default Python version for your entire system or set different Python versions for specific directories or projects.

- Virtual environments: pyenv also integrates with virtual environment tools like [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or virtualenv, allowing you to create isolated development environments for each project. This helps avoid conflicts between different project requirements.

- Switching versions: With pyenv, you can easily switch between different Python versions. For example, if you have a project that requires Python 3.7 and another project that needs Python 3.9, you can switch between those versions using the pyenv command.

Overall, version managers like pyenv provide flexibility and convenience in managing multiple Python versions on your system, ensuring compatibility with different projects and their specific requirements.
